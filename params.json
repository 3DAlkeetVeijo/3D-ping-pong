The gyroscope is to be used as an indicator as to how far the arm is loaded, and the Piezo as a push sensor with which the loading would be orcestrated. ![A sketch of the initial idea](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1825043/IMG_20160329_133513.jpg)\r\n\r\n### 2nd stage\r\n\r\nThe round 3D-printed base was dumped in the process and exchanged to a slightly more convenient model that could be cut out of cardboard and later the final material, for example plywood or some plastic. This was mainly due to the inconvenient time consumption of printing prototypes. The box and the gears that would turn the arm on the x-axis were designed. ![The first parts](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1825043/testbox.svg)\r\n\r\n### 3rd stage\r\n\r\nNow that we had a design on paper and on the computer, we wanted to make our first prototype out of cardboard to see if the design was even close to what we had imagined.\r\nIn the first print we noticed that our scaling was a little of, so back to the drawing table we went. The inner parts were measured and the motor's measures were taken off the internet to make our gears operable by the motor. Soon, we had a new set of parts to be cut, and off we went.\r\nThe second cut was successful and the first prototype was assembled. Note that the pen was used to move the arm, and the motor is going to be on the inside of the box later. ![The assembled prototype numero uno.](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1825043/IMG_20160415_135258.jpg)\r\n\r\n### 4th stage\r\n\r\nThe software part of the project was started using an online arduino simulator using AUTODESK (https://123d.circuits.io/). The two motors and four buttons, that are used to control the moving parts of the catapult, were simulated and working. ![Picture of the simulated catapult-core](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ii71jvm44r0erqz/3D-mallintaminen_arduino-simulaatio.png?dl=0)\r\n\r\nOn the hardware side, the first version of the circuit was drawn as shown below. A later version of this test circuit will be used for the prototype and later in the final product. ![The first version of the circuit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3DAlkeetVeijo/3D-ping-pong/pcb/brd.png)",
