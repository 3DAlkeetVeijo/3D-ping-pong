<p>Our group came up with the idea of making a catapult, inspired by beer pong, to crush humankind in this noble sport.
Soon we had a sketch of the machine we were going to build.
The hand itself turns on the x-axis between -/+ 15 degrees, to ensure a wide enough range on a couple meters distance. The gyroscope is to be used as an indicator as to how far the arm is loaded, and the Piezo as a push sensor with which the loading would be orcestrated. <img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1825043/IMG_20160329_133513.jpg" alt="A sketch of the initial idea"></p>

<a id="2nd-stage" class="anchor" href="#2nd-stage" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2nd stage</h3>

<p>The round 3D-printed base was dumped in the process and exchanged to a slightly more convenient model that could be cut out of cardboard and later the final material, for example plywood or some plastic. This was mainly due to the inconvenient time consumption of printing prototypes. The box and the gears that would turn the arm on the x-axis were designed. <img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1825043/testbox.svg" alt="The first parts"></p>

<h3>
<a id="3rd-stage" class="anchor" href="#3rd-stage" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3rd stage</h3>

<p>Now that we had a design on paper and on the computer, we wanted to make our first prototype out of cardboard to see if the design was even close to what we had imagined.
In the first print we noticed that our scaling was a little of, so back to the drawing table we went. The inner parts were measured and the motor's measures were taken off the internet to make our gears operable by the motor. Soon, we had a new set of parts to be cut, and off we went.
The second cut was successful and the first prototype was assembled. Note that the pen was used to move the arm, and the motor is going to be on the inside of the box later. <img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1825043/IMG_20160415_135258.jpg" alt="The assembled prototype numero uno."></p>

<h3>
<a id="4th-stage" class="anchor" href="#4th-stage" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>4th stage</h3>

<p>The software part of the project was started using an online arduino simulator using AUTODESK (<a href="https://123d.circuits.io/">https://123d.circuits.io/</a>). The two motors and four buttons, that are used to control the moving parts of the catapult, were simulated and working. <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3DAlkeetVeijo/3D-ping-pong/3D-ping-pong-projekti/3D-mallintaminen_arduino-simulaatio.png" alt="Picture of the simulated catapult-core"></p>

<p>On the hardware side, the first version of the circuit was drawn as shown below. A later version of this test circuit will be used for the prototype and later in the final product. <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3DAlkeetVeijo/3D-ping-pong/pcb/brd-2.png" alt="The first version of the circuit"></p>

<h3>
<a id="5th-stage" class="anchor" href="#5th-stage" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>5th stage</h3>

<p>A blueprint of the connections was made including the circuit shown before, the arduino itself and the H-bridges used to control the motors. The theoretical part is closing in on a stage in which changes are hard to make without a real life prototype. The software was uploaded to github in a new branch (3D-ping-pong-projekti). <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3DAlkeetVeijo/3D-ping-pong/pcb/sch.png" alt=""></p>

<p>As the FabLab is closed, any further progress is waiting for the making of the circuit and getting the required buttons and the additional motor.</p>

<h3>
<a id="6th-stage" class="anchor" href="#6th-stage" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>6th stage</h3>

<p>To make it possible to connect the arduino to our H-bridges we designed a arduino shield that we could simply drop the arduino into and have everything wired up. However our first try at making a PCB resulted in a slight failure. Possibly because the milling parameters were not set correctly too much copper was removed making the board quite hard to use. We also didn't find drill bits small enough to actually drill the holes for attaching the arduino board to this new PCB so a decision was made to design a simpler board to replace this one.

<p>The design we came up with is a simple breakout board for the two small H-bridge chips. Making it easy to wire them up to both the arduino and the dc motors.

<p>For the PCB designs we started with Eagle CAD software and exported the design to a PNG image. The PNG image could then be edited in GIMP to be more suited for the milling process. The milling was done using a Roland SRM-20 machine. All the control files for the machine were created using fabmodules.org.</p>

<p>The rest of the pieces were retrieved from FabLab and measured for the final blueprints as shown below<br>

<p>The next step is to draw the blueprints by hand and print and cut the structures.</p>

<h3>
<a id="8th-stage" class="anchor" href="#8th-stage" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>8th stage</h3>

<p>Hand drawn blueprints were made to help the designing of the parts. The box and cogwheels from before are usable, now the throwing arm, its base and the container of the big motor doing the throwing are to be designed.
    Atleast the container has to be drawn and printed in 3D. We try to make the other parts cuttable to save time in the manufacturing of the parts.<br>
