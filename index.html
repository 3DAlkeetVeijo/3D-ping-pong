<p>Our group came up with the idea of making a catapult, inspired by beer pong, to crush humankind in this noble sport.
Soon we had a sketch of the machine we were going to build.
The hand itself turns on the x-axis between -/+ 15 degrees, to ensure a wide enough range on a couple meters distance. The gyroscope is to be used as an indicator as to how far the arm is loaded, and the Piezo as a push sensor with which the loading would be orcestrated. <img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1825043/IMG_20160329_133513.jpg" alt="A sketch of the initial idea"></p>

<p>The round 3D-printed base was dumped in the process and exchanged to a slightly more convenient model that could be cut out of cardboard and later the final material, for example plywood or some plastic. This was mainly due to the inconvenient time consumption of printing prototypes. The box and the gears that would turn the arm on the x-axis were designed. <img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1825043/testbox.svg" alt="The first parts"></p>

<a id="3rd-stage" class="anchor" href="#3rd-stage" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3rd stage</h3>

<p>Now that we had a design on paper and on the computer, we wanted to make our first prototype out of cardboard to see if the design was even close to what we had imagined.
In the first print we noticed that our scaling was a little of, so back to the drawing table we went. The inner parts were measured and the motor's measures were taken off the internet to make our gears operable by the motor. Soon, we had a new set of parts to be cut, and off we went.
The second cut was successful and the first prototype was assembled. Note that the pen was used to move the arm, and the motor is going to be on the inside of the box later. <img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1825043/IMG_20160415_135258.jpg" alt="The assembled prototype numero uno."></p>

<a id="4th-stage" class="anchor" href="#4th-stage" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>4th stage</h3>

<p>The software part of the project was started using an online arduino simulator using AUTODESK (<a href="https://123d.circuits.io/">https://123d.circuits.io/</a>). The two motors and four buttons, that are used to control the moving parts of the catapult, were simulated and working. <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3DAlkeetVeijo/3D-ping-pong/3D-ping-pong-projekti/3D-mallintaminen_arduino-simulaatio.png" alt="Picture of the simulated catapult-core"></p>

<p>On the hardware side, the first version of the circuit was drawn as shown below. A later version of this test circuit will be used for the prototype and later in the final product. <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3DAlkeetVeijo/3D-ping-pong/pcb/brd.png" alt="The first version of the circuit"></p>
